# Linode-instance-price-monitoring-robot
A robot that monitors the current price of a provisioned Linode instance, and sends email alert to the appropriate personnels whenever the price exceeds their budget 

### This branch runs the robot using heroku dynamo and a custome python module for scheduling runs. This is no longer a free service on Heroku at the moment. See the updated part of this code in the [dev]() branch of this repository that leverages github actions for running the robot
